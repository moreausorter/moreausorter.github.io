# Moreau-First-Year-Sorter

## Project Description:
This group of individuals, working closely with Assistant Professor Shreya Kumar and Mallory Jagodzinski, is working towards developing a Moreau section sorter and recommender proposed by Katrina Higgins. This project will work to place students in the Moreau section that works best for their schedule and automate the process that is currently done manually by First Year Advising.
